2.from that location we have to open command prompt

3.in that cmd run a command for creating django project

	i.e "django-admin startproject projectname"

4.when i run this command it will generate two different files
        -> first one is folder with name of project
	->manage.py :by using this file we can run our django server
	->__init__:
	->settings.py:
	->urls.py:
	->wsgi(web service gateway interface):therse two files useful for hosting purpose
	->asgi:(asynchronous server gateway interface)


App Creation:
------------
procedure:

1.before going to create your app first of all you have to check
   where your manage.py is existed

2.in that location only we are creating user  application

3.in that purpose we are change our directory to manage.py file location

       i.e cd projectname

4.for creating user app we have to run a command 

   	i.e "python manage.py startapp appname"

5.it will generate few files

	-> migrations: 
	->__init__:
	->admin.py:
	->app.py: 
	->models.py:
	->test.py:
	->views.py:
 



6.after creating app we have to register our app in settings.py

7. python manage.py runserver


     localhost:8000/hi

	o/p: hi welcome to django session

-> path('urlname/',fn name,name of the url)



HttpRequest:
1.GET:if user sends request from url that means request type is "GET"

2.POST:if the request is coming from html page then request type is "POST"
